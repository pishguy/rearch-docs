# Scoping State (Injections)
Scoping state may be achieved via the combination of a `RearchConsumer` in conjunction
with a new `InheritedWidget`.

However, since that results in a _ton_ of boilerplate,
ReArch comes with a builtin `RearchInjection` widget that "injects" state into the widget tree:

```dart
/// Provides the current count to descendants in the [Widget] tree.
class CountInjection extends RearchInjection<CountInjection, ValueWrapper<int>> {
  const CountInjection({required super.child, super.key});

  @override
  ValueWrapper<int> build(BuildContext context, WidgetHandle use) {
    return use.data(0);
  }

  static ValueWrapper<int> of(BuildContext context) =>
      RearchInjection.of<CountInjection, ValueWrapper<int>>(context);

  static ValueWrapper<int>? maybeOf(BuildContext context) =>
      RearchInjection.maybeOf<CountInjection, ValueWrapper<int>>(context);
}

const SomeWidget(
  child: CountInjection(
    child: Builder(
      builder: (context) {
        final count = CountInjection.of(context);
        return Text('${count.value}');
      },
    ),
  ),
)
```
