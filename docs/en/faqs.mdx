## Do state side effects trigger rebuilds internally?
Yes! As a general rule of thumb,
any side effect that mutates some state _external to the build_
and then _returns that state_ or a value dependent upon that state
will likely trigger rebuilds.
As an example, `setState` updates a value extenal to the capsule build itself (it is a callback),
and `use.state` returns `state`, so it triggers a rebuild.
While `use.memo` updates a state value, it is done within the build itself,
so it doesn't trigger any rebuilds.


## Does `rebuild()` trigger rebuilds immediately? Or can you call it back-to-back?
For capsules: yes.
Calling `rebuild()` multiple times in a row will trigger multiple rebuilds.
This is also true for calling different `setState`s or similar back-to-back;
multiple rebuilds are triggered.
As this is often undesirable, ReArch has "side effect transactions"
that can run a bunch of side effects in one batch to result in one rebuild.
```dart
final runTransaction = use.transactionRunner();
void updateMultipleEffectsInOneBuild() {
  runTransaction(() {
    setState1(1234);
	setState2(4321);
	invalidateFuture();
	somethingElseThatMayRebuild();
  });
}
```
For Flutter widgets: no.
Rebuilds are automatically batched together on the next frame via flutterâ€™s build scheduler
(ReArch internally calls
[`Element.markNeedsBuild`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Element/markNeedsBuild.html)).
> You can read more about "side effect transactions" [here](/core/effects).


## (Dart/Flutter) What is the purpose of `SideEffectRegistrar.register()`?
`use.register()`, as it is often seen, is meant to implement rather low-level side effects,
and thus you often won't need to use it directly.
It essentially is a combination of a way to access the outside world
(via the `SideEffectApi`),
coupled with a way to call some certain function _only on the first build_,
which can be used to persist state across builds.


## (Dart/Flutter) How can I use ReArch with `fpdart`? Specifically, the `Option`s clash.
