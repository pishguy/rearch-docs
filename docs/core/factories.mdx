# Factories
Factories (also known as factory capsules) are not unique to rearch at all;
in fact, rearch just borrows the concept from OOP!
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_(object-oriented_programming)):
> In object-oriented programming, a factory is an object for creating other objects;
formally, it is a function or method that returns objects of a varying prototype or class

In rearch, factories are just capsules that create objects on the fly and can consume some additional non-capsule parameters.
Although factories may seem complex, they actually just boil down to some very straight forward syntactic sugar.

<Info>If you are coming from Riverpod, factories solve problems similar to those covered by Family & AutoDispose providers.</Info>


## An Example
<CodeGroup title="Example Factory Capsule">
  ```dart
  int dependency1Capsule(CapsuleHandle _) => 0;
  String dependency2Capsule(CapsuleHandle _) => 'hello world!';

  MyObject Function(String, int) myObjectFactory(CapsuleHandle use) {
    // Notice how we only call `use` *before returning the factory closure*;
    // this is important, as you cannot call `use` across an asynchronous gap.
    // In other words, *DO NOT CALL USE WITHIN THE FACTORY BODY ITSELF*.
    final dep1 = use(dependency1Capsule);
    final dep2 = use(dependency2Capsule);
    return (dep3, dep4) => MyObject(dep1, dep2, dep3, dep4);
  }

  void usesFactoryCapsule(CapsuleHandle use) {
    final MyObject obj = use(myObjectFactory)('some string', 1234);
    obj.doSomething();
  }

  // A macro like the following is *planned* to make this easier/less error-prone.
  // If you would like to see this macro sooner rather than later, please +1 this issue:
  // https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/3210
  @factoryCapsule
  MyObject myObjectFactory(
    // Capsule dependencies:
    @dependency1Capsule int dep1,
    @dependency2Capsule String dep2,
    // Factory parameters:
    String dep3,
    int dep4,
  ) {
    return MyObject(dep1, dep2, dep3, dep4);
  }
  ```

  ```rust
  fn dep1(_: CapsuleHandle) -> i8 {
      0
  }
  fn dep2(_: CapsuleHandle) -> &'static str {
      "hello world!"
  }

  fn my_obj_factory(
      CapsuleHandle { mut get, .. }: CapsuleHandle,
      // Note: in the line below, `Clone + Send + Sync` is on `impl Fn`, *not* `MyObject`.
  ) -> impl Fn(String, i8) -> MyObject + Clone + Send + Sync {
    let dep1 = get(dep1);
    let dep2 = get(dep2);
    move |dep3, dep4| MyObject::new(dep1, dep2, dep3, dep4)
  }

  fn uses_factory(CapsuleHandle { mut get, .. }: CapsuleHandle) {
    let obj: MyObject = get(my_obj_factory)("some string".to_owned(), 1234);
    obj.do_something();
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Just like in capsules, factories are recreated whenever their dependency capsule(s) change,
  and anything consuming the factory will be given a new instance of the factory!
  In most situations, you will want to create a new instance of any factory-created objects
  whenever the factory instance itself changes.
</Warning>


## Caching Created Objects
<Info>
  Currently, this section only provides examples using the Dart implementation,
  since caching factory-created objects is often not needed and is not as trivial in Rust.
  (Although if you do need to, take a look at the `run_on_change` side effect.)
</Info>

If you need to:
- Cache a factory-created object (perhaps until the factory instance changes)
- Dispose old factory-created objects to prevent leaks (perhaps when a new object is created)

Then take a look at the following snippet.

If you are familiar with React or `flutter_hooks`, this will feel exceedingly natural to you.
See the dedicated documentation page on side effects for more.

```dart title="Caching objects created with factories"
MyCustomObject defaultParamMyCustomObjCapsule(CapsuleHandle use) {
  // Our factory capsule:
  final objFactory = use(objFactoryCapsule);

  // Some arbitrary capsule that may cause a rebuild
  // even when objFactory itself doesn't change:
  final someString = use(someCapsule);

  // Only recreate myObj when objFactory or someString change
  final myObj = use.memo(() {
    return objFactory(someString);
  }, [objFactory, someString]);

  // Whenever myObj changes, register the new object for disposal
  use.effect(() => myObj.dispose, [myObj]);

  return myObj;
}
```

This combination of `memo` and `effect` is *very* common,
especially when handling `FooBarController`s,
so it is best to learn how to use them early on.
